    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I am a highly motivated Computer Science + Data Science Student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with previous knowledge and research experience in AI field. 
        Prior to joining my current university, I studied AI degree at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and worked as a research assistant at Computer Vision Center Barcelona. 
        Later, I served as an undergraduate researcher at Wisconsin-Madison affiliate under the School of Engineering. 
        On top of that, as a proficient multilingual in Spanish, English, and Chinese, I possess a unique global perspective nurtured through education across diverse cultural contexts. 
        I established a strong foundation in Chinese primary education, followed by completing from my middle school to the sophomore year in Spain. 
        After being accepted to a regarded U.S. University in Computer Science, I transferred to the United States aiming for a higher quality education.
